CASE 1 : BINARY GAPS
-------------------------------------------
Given a positive integer N, return the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
For example : 
N = 15
The binary representation : 1111 and has no binary gaps.

N=20
The binary representation : 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1.

N=9
The binary representation : 1001 and contains a binary gap of leneth 2.

N= 529
The binary representation : 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps, they are : one of length 4 and one of length 3.
